Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
- The client of this project is DriverPass. DriverPass would like to create an application to train new drivers on their road course tests. They would like their application to be a cloud-based application that can show online classes, while also being able to book in-person training appointments. They would also like the application to be able to pull data from the DMV and alert them of any new rules or regulations. 

What did you do particularly well?
- In this project, I really excelled at the organization. With the large number of visual aids we produced, I found it enjoyable to make the flow charts and visualize the process steps. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
- If I could revise a part of my work in this course, I would take more time to explain my visual aids. I found that I spent too much time making my visuals organized and visually pleasing that I did not do good enough work at explaining what my processes were in writing. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
- The number one goal of designing a project should be to consider the user's needs. The user is the one paying for the completion of the project and if they request something, it is the developer’s responsibility to provide that or an explanation on why they couldn't provide it. I personally dissected the interview that we were provided and made each of the customers need a subject. Then, I would write an explanation for that subject and consider what other subjects may interact with it. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
- I design software very methodically. I feel that breaking down the information and then organizing that info is very helpful in designing software. The more organized a team can be in its development approach the better chance of success they have. From there, I really enjoyed making visual aids in this semester. It may be something I use from now on as it gives a great step-by-step process that is easy to look at and understand.
